1. Transitions & Transforms:


	I. Transitions:	

		- "transforms" move or change the appearance of an element, while "transitions" make the element smoothly and gradually change from one state to another.

		SYNTAX:
		- Below is the shorthand property for "transition-property", "transition-duration" etc.
		- Only first two are required ("property" & "duration"), the remaining two are optional properties.

				div {
				  transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
				}

			property  = ( all | transform | background-color )
				//you may apply a transition to an individual property (i.e., background-color or tranform) or to all properties in the rule-set (i.e., all)

		DEMO:
				img {			
					transition: all 1s;		
				}	/* all properties of "img" acquire a lag of 1s, including "transform" (when hovered)*/
				img:hover {							
					transform: scale(1.2);			/*transform op*/
				}


		NOTE:
			1. "transitions" & "transform" are called "CSS Power couple" & are often used together.
		    2. However, "transitions" can also be used elsewhere where elements change from one style to another (e.g., when a button changes color on hover).
