Package.json
	this is a file that node generates for us.
	it contains all the references to all the dependencies that are required.



steps:
	0. first, go to the desired folder location (generally referred as root folder for React Proj) in Command Prompt
	
	1. type "npm init" 		-->  creates Package.json and adds references to some neccessary dependencies

	2. type "npm install react --save"   --> this installs React & ReactDOM packages for us.
	
	3. type "npm install react-dom --save"
	creating components or react packages  --> react package
	rendering components  or elements to html page --> react dom package

	4.  "npm install webpack --save"
		"npm install webpack-dev-server --save"
		"npm install webpack-cli --save"
		"npm install babel --save"

		webpack 
			-> module bundler --> manages all you modules and loads independent modules 
	        -> also run the application in our local host --> change/modify the local host

		babel 
			-> plugins/dependencies

	NOTE: webpack and babel are used to make our system a local host and it helps our system to act like a server and support code 

	


	6. index.html --> <div> template
	7. index.js   -->  creating & rendering
				--> import them & then render those components
	
		"type nul > index.js"
		

	8. UI & Functionality:
		app.js --> container for allour components: (creating components)
		<comp 1>
		<comp2>
		<comp3> --> export your components








		npm install -g create-react-app
