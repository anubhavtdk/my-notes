Components in React

1. class component 			- stateful component (everything depends on positioning)
2. functional component 	- not a stateful comp ()

"this" keyword


NOTE:
 functions can be defined in two ways/formats in JS:
 	1. conventional function
 	2. arrow function


functional components  => no use of "this" keyword

Also,
 functional Components + Hooks  	=>  - makes the functional components stateful and better organized
 										- better at everything when compared to just functional comp alone

VS code shortcuts
 you type 'rcc' and press enter - you get skeleton class component definition

  &ensp 	for space
  &nsbp 	for space
